To Do List Application 

In your pairs/groups, create a React application that allows a user to generate a To Do List! How useful! 

Things to keep in mind 
- React is meant to build modular applications! Keep your components modular! 
- You do not need to test drive this. We will talk about testing React after you've gotten your feet on the ground with React first! 

Requirements:
- An input at the top where a user can input their username and click "Submit Username"
- "Welcome, ____!" should appear on the screen with the user's name in the blank after they've submitted their name 
- A box where a user can input a new to do item (there is no limit to how many they may add) that says "Add!"
- An option to "complete" which will delete the item from the screen that says "Delete!"
- A "Finish All" button that would remove all items from the list 

Advanced Requirements: 
- Style! Select fonts, colors, backgrounds, and images that make this look good and professional 
- Make the data persist if the page is refreshed 
- Provide an input field for "category" that will allow the user to assign a category to each to do item 
(For example: "Yard Work" and the to do items in that category might be "Weeding" and "Mowing the lawn")
- Add a gif for when someone clicks "Finish All" to pop up and congratulate them on their list being completed 

Nightmare Mode Requirements: 
- Deploy this app to Heroku 
- Research React Hooks and attempt to implement at least 1 hook in this application
- Add Context to your application
